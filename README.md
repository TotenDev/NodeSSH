# NodeSSH

A lightweight SSH Client for Node.js.

## About

NodeSSH is a SSH client for node.js. I would call it lightweight, but since it spawns subprocesses, this makes it heavyweight to me. It uses OpenSSH and expect. Make sure you have installed this software.

Use your system's built-in package manager (apt-get,yum,rpm,dselect,etc..) to install expect on you machine. Most systems (OSX included) should already have this installed. This will not work with windows machines.

## Requirements

- [npm](https://github.com/isaacs/npm)
- [OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.org)

## Installation

Download and install dependencies

    $ npm install

## Usage

    var options = { host:"localhost", username:"USER", password:"PASS", port: 22 };
    var SSHClient = require("NodeSSH")(options);
    SSHClient.on("connected",function (host) {
	    SSHClient.exec("pwd",function(data){ 
	    	console.log("Server response:",data);
	    	SSHClient.close(); 
	    });
    })
    SSHClient.connect();

#### Connect Session

---
#### Write Command

This function will not call error listener, it'll call 'output'/'input'/'stderr' events.

    SSHClient.on("connected",function (host) {
	SSHClient.exec("pwd",function(data){
		SSHClient.close();
	});
})

---
#### Close session
This method will close SSH session.

Sample:

    SSHClient.close();


## Events

		console.log("Connected to host:",host);
	});
---
####Closed

Event-String: `closed`

Sample:

	//Connections events
	SSHClient.on("closed",function (host) {
		console.log("Disconnected from host:",host);
	});
---
####Error

Event-String: `error`

Sample:

	//Connections events
	SSHClient.on("error",function (host,err) {

		console.log("Disconnected from host:",host);
	});	
---
####Input 
This event will be fired when any command from you is written on remote connection stream.

Event-String: `input`
